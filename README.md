Puzzle Node Solutions
=====================

These are my solutions to the problems on http://puzzlenode.com.

I am putting these out on GitHub for a couple reasons.  First, I want a centralized location for my code and second, I think it may be beneficial to others.

I'm putting each solution in a folder in this Git repository.  Go to the corresponding folder to find a README specific to that puzzle.

I have recently finished (I think) the tourists puzzle and I'm currently working on the robots vs lasers puzzle.
